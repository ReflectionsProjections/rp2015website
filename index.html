                        Hello cybercommander!
                        <br><br>
                        The 21st annual Military Electronic Combat Hardware Training Competition (Mechmania) is fast approaching! The competition ranks cyberwarriors by pitting them against each other in a simulated cyber-warfare environment. However, there is one major catch – since the United Nations Network Security Agency (UN-NSA) deems it too dangerous for human cyberwarriors to participate, they have instructed you to build a computer program to do so instead!
                        <br><br>
                        Should you accept this mission, you and up to 3 friends will have 24 hours to build, test, and deploy your automatic cyberwarriors against the world’s finest cybercommanders. The UN-NSA will provide meals and snacks to all participants as well as prizes for the best performances.
                        <br>
                        Good luck, cybercommander. You’ll need it out there.
                        <br><br>

                        PuzzleBang, the annual week-long puzzle contest, is back again in 2015!  Teams will solve a series of puzzles throughout the week, concluding with a metapuzzle on Saturday.  Just finding out about PuzzleBang?  It's not too late!  Grab a few friends and give this puzzle a shot!

                        <h3>High-risk, high-reward careers</h3>
                        <p>As you study Computer Science or a related field, you also plan your post-college career. Will you join a big, well-known company or a smaller operation where you can have more impact? Perhaps you’ll join a fledgling start-up or even launch your own company. In this talk, Alan Braverman will try to steer you towards the riskiest options (and convince you that they aren’t even all that risky).</p>

                        <p>The web is throwing an ES6 party, and you're invited. ECMAScript 2015 (6th Edition) is the latest version of the ECMAScript Language Specification standard. Commonly referred to as "ES6", it has changed the way we think about writing web applications for the better. In this talk, I'll be telling you the whos, the whats, the whens, the wheres, and the whys of ES6, the challenges it presents, and the advantages it provides.</p>

                        <p>Craig Reynolds was a pioneer applying computer animation to special effects in feature films, to autonomous characters in games, and making tools for these fields. His research is on procedural models for geometry, animation, behavior and texture synthesis. Currently he writes vision software at Matterport in Mountain View, California. Like Howard Wolowitz, he has a masters degree from MIT (1978).</p>
                        <h3>Computational Models of Natural Complexity</h3>
                        <p>Procedural models allow simulation of complex natural phenomenon, which let us better understand the natural system. They also allow us to recreate the phenomenon and control it for use in animation, games and the arts. This talk will cover several such models, including: flocking and other group motion—stigmergy and collective construction—and the evolution of camouflage to avoid predation.</p>

                        <p>Greg was a student in the UIUC CS program way back at the turn of the millennium. He failed out in 2003 after struggling with a nasty bout of bipolar disorder and ADHD. Today he serves in his dream job as a developer evangelist at Twilio. He lives in Chicago with his wife and one year old daughter.</p>
                        <p>So many UIUC students are struggling alone with depression, anxiety, ADHD, bipolar and other mental illnesses. Unfortunately, there's a lot of stigma around these diseases, and we don't talk about it much because we're afraid of being shunned or being called lazy. After this talk, you'll have a better idea of how to recognize mental illnesses in yourself and others, how to seek professional help, and how to get rid of the crippling shame. </p>

                        <p>What happens when you leave the cushy playground of academia to join the working world and build a start-up? What do you learn in the transition from student to entrepreneur? How do you go from crazy idea to venture backed start-up? After ten years of working in start-ups and R&D I think I may have some insights, or a least a list of things that I wish someone had told me when I was still wet behind the ears. This talk outlines ten hard-learned and actionable lessons from the real world. Topics covered include: CS 666: the dark arts of computer science, how to get an MBA from the Wu-Tang School of Business, sleeping on the floor and eating boiled newspapers, and the 80/20 rule.</p>

His thesis focused on building systems that allow developers to rapidly build scalable interactive applications, and specifically defined the notion of scale independence. His interests broadly include distributed systems, large-scale structured storage and query optimization</p>
                        <p>Apache Spark is an open-source distributed computing framework, initially created by graduate students at UC Berkeley.  By providing rich APIs and in-memory primitives, Spark allows users to analyze huge amounts of data at record speeds, using 2-5x less code that other frameworks.  I'll describe Spark and do a live demo of interactive analysis on millions of tweets.  I'll also talk about the open-source community and how you can get involved in the project.</p>

                        <p>Roy Bahat leads Bloomberg Beta, an early-stage venture fund backed by Bloomberg L.P. that invests in startups that make work better, and (inspired by software engineers) open sourced its investment manual. Roy is a lecturer at UC Berkeley. He was the founding chairman of OUYA, a Kickstarter-backed game console, and president of IGN Entertainment. He hired software engineers without looking at their resumes. Roy graduated from Harvard College, and was a Rhodes Scholar.</p>
                        <h3>Your career to come -- it will be a mess</h3>
                        <p>The next 20 years of work will look different than the last 50. Instead of having a linear succession of jobs, more people now have a portfolio of activities. For people who practice a trade -- engineers -- or for startup founders, since their lives are less often “ready for LinkedIn,” how do you prepare to succeed in that world, where skills and relationships matter more than titles?</p>

                        <p>Navigating our financial journey is a daunting task yet doing it well is crucial to achieving our life goals. How to purchase a home? What is a mortgage? How do I save for retirement? Bankrate.com is a personal finance website aimed at empowering the public with educational articles and all the information you need to make important financial decisions at all life stages. It is also a one-stop marketplace that connects visitors to financial services providers. Data science plays a key role in ensuring visitors to our site get what they are looking for and that we uphold our reputation as a trusted marketplace. In this talk, I will share several exciting machine learning projects and internal data products that we are working on to achieve these goals.</p>

                        <p>Gopal Kakivaya is a CVP working on Microsoft Azure cloud computing initiative. He has spent well over a decade working at the forefront of Microsoft’s distributed-computing efforts. The highlight of his work has been leading the conception, incubation, development, and successful deployment of a ground-breaking distributed systems technology called “Azure Service Fabric.” Service Fabric is the distributed systems foundation on which many Microsoft’s internet scale services like Azure DB, Bing Cortana, Windows Intune, Azure Resource Providers, etc. are built. With Service Fabric, Gopal has demonstrated how to combine the scale and decentralization characteristics of edge (P2P) networks with the consistency guarantees demanded by the datacenter networks. Service Fabric creates a scale-free self-healing mesh of commodity computers that can be extended all the way from the cloud to the edge. It has solved many challenging and important distributed systems problems like reliable failure detection, perfect leader election, consensus, failover, and much more.</p>

                            if walking isn't for you then Champaign-Urbana's public transit system can take you
                            where you need to go. Routes can be mapped using Google Maps or the CUMTD app and each
                            ride will cost you $1. No change is given on the buses, so bring exact fare with you!</p>
