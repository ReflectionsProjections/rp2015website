                        <br>
                        Hello cybercommander!
                        <br><br>
                        The 21st annual Military Electronic Combat Hardware Training Competition (Mechmania) is fast approaching! The competition ranks cyberwarriors by pitting them against each other in a simulated cyber-warfare environment. However, there is one major catch - since the United Nations Network Security Agency (UN-NSA) deems it too dangerous for human cyberwarriors to participate, they have instructed you to build a computer program to do so instead!
                        <br><br>
                        Should you accept this mission, you and up to 3 friends will have 24 hours to build, test, and deploy your automatic cyberwarriors against the world’s finest cybercommanders. The UN-NSA will provide meals and snacks to all participants as well as prizes for the best performances.
                        <br>
                        Good luck, cybercommander. You’ll need it out there.
                        <br><br>

                        PuzzleBang is an annual puzzle contest held during ACM R|P conferences where participants complete perplexing problems for a chance to win great prizes! Modelled after decade-old Urbana-Champaign traditions, PuzzleBang brings people together in order to solve classical algorithmic puzzles. Students are encouraged to form teams of 2-4 in order to compete in the week-long puzzle challenge. These Problems are geared towards both experienced competitors and new participants alike. If you’ve never competed in a puzzle contest before, don’t be afraid to join in on the fun!
                        <br><br>
                        Prizes will be awarded to the top 3 teams and extra follow-up prizes will be given to teams that weren’t in the top three, but did well during the week. Come join us for a great time!

                        Hackathon and hacker culture is on the rise, and Illinois has taken it to heart. Many students in ACM@UIUC participate in hackathons, and there are plenty of amazing projects that they have created.
                        <br><br>
                        Reflections|Projections and HackIllinios proudly present Projects@RP. Our student hackers and innovators will be demoing their projects and showing off the Illini hacker enthusiasm. Projects will range from SIG projects developed over months to hackathon projects created in days. Come see what Illinois hackers are doing!

                        <p>Willard Airport is located nouth of UIUC. If driving, head north from the airport on the 45 and turn right onto Springfield - you'll soon find yourself on UIUC campus! Alternatively, you can catch a cab from the airport to the building or the 27N/270N Airbus will take you from Willard to the corner of Goodwin St and Clark St just outside the building.</p>

                        <p>Siebel Center is located 1 mile from the Champaign Amtrak Station. Most buses will take you to campus with the 100S and 120E running every few minutes. Ride one of these buses to the intersection of Wright St and White St, then walk east on Stoughton and you will find yourself at the Siebel Center!</p>

                        <h5>Getting around Campus</h5>
                        <p>Most amenities are available within walking distance of the Siebel Center. However, if walking isn't for you then the Champaign-Urbana's public transit system, can take you where you need to go. Routes can be mapped using Google Maps or the CUMTD app and each ride will cost you $1. No change is given on the buses, so bring exact fare with you!</p>
